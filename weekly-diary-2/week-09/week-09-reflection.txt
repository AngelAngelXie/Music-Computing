# Week 9 reflection

Week 9’s diary involves two components: independent exploration on modulation and group collaboration. 

In exploring dynamic modulation, I built on top of automated and randomized techniques covered in class to create more complex evolving textures. For instance, I tested LFO-driven modulation using sine.range() and tri.range() to parameters like cutoff, which converted static patterns into fluid, organic sequences. The slow LFOs on filter cutoffs create a sense of breathing movement, while the triangular wave modulation on the standalone synth’s lpf introduces unpredictability, contrasting with the smoother sine waves in the stacked sections.

I also experimented with ways of building more interesting envelope-based modulation to shape filter sweeps dynamically. I added more varieties by adding conditional effects and putting more than one parameters to modulation functions. The result is a very complex single sequence whose sound changes dynamically and gives off a futuristic/space theme. 

During our group session, we each took the role of drums, leads, bass. I contributed a lead track and adopted my note sequence to sound harmonious to my groupmates’. In our collaborative performance, I tried adjusting the speed, loudness, and swapped between scales to create more interesting effects.
