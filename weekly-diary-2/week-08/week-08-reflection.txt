# Week 8 reflection

This piece explores algorithmic music composition using drums, bass, lead, and freaky noises. I took this opportunity to experiment with different Strudel functions and built on top of strudal code from lecture slides to create a piece with variety and structure. 

The drum section uses Euclidean rhythms to distribute hits evenly, while angle brackets introduce polyrhythmic alternation. The .every() function dynamically swaps sounds, adding variety to the beat. I layered acoustic and synthetic sounds like casio and metal to create a textured, evolving groove. 

I created three bass tracks: two sustained acoustic bass using gm_acoustic_bass and one glitchy sine waves. In one of the basses, I used .segment() and .range() to generate melodic fragments. To avoid muddiness, I kept lower octaves sparse and used .delay() to stagger entries. The Ritusen scale provided an exotic, unresolved tonality. 

In my leads, I employs .every() to swap between a simple triangle melody and a complex, nested pattern with kawai synth. 

For the freaky noises, I interleaved the wind, crow, insect, and metal sound sources using .every() and randomized delays. I also created one euclidean-distributed sine waves in the breakdown to create a chaotic yet rhythmic bed.
