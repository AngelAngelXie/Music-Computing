# Week 3 reflection

This week’s diary uses audio to compose a piece about ourselves. As a computer science student, I chose to interleave a simple melody and an audio recording of someone coding. 

I specifically chose a simple melody so that I can experiment with different ways of manipulating the sound of it. By layering different versions of the same melody, I am hoping it can use the sound to capture my state of mind when I become completely absorbed in my coding tasks. I spent a lot of time online trying to see the ways in which we can manipulate the same audio file to have different sound effects. For instance, I experimented with randomly playing segment pieces of the melody at one point to resemble the moments when I get streams of ideas for my work. Other concepts like tremolo or delays are used to show moments when my mind becomes cluttered. Even though I didn’t include everything I explored in the piece, this piece gave me practice in what I can do with audio manipulation.
