# Week 2 reflection

This week, we had a brief introduction into music and how to use pd. One idea that I found particularly enlightening is when our lecturer points out that a computer music piece is not limited to our traditional impression of music with melodies and rhythms. Using pd, we can manipulate sounds in such a way that it triggers our brains to remember some symbols or moments. With the limitation of using only two distinct sounds, I drew inspiration from the above idea and created my diary piece, which intends to mimic the sound of a busy road on a rainy day.

In particular, I utilized the “noise” function discussed in class and applied different filters to it to create the sound effects I like. I think the piece turned out quite successful in capturing the impression I am hoping to create. With only two sounds, I was pondering how I can add stories and nuances to the piece. Therefore, I tried manually modifying the amplitude of the two sounds, thereby adding dynamic to the sounds and hopefully inviting my listeners to imagine the scene of a rainy road with me.
